# Employee_Tracker

# Project Phases

Three databases were programmed using the MySQL2 package. These databases included: department, role and employee. Department included department name and ID. Role included department ID, title, salary and department ID. Employee included ID, first name, last name, role ID and manager ID. Once the schema.sql and seeds.sql files were created and populated with sql code I created the databases, described the databases and then populated the databases with the seeds.sql data in MySQL. I then installed Inquirer to interact with the user via a command line and installed the console.table.package to print MySQL rows into the console.
